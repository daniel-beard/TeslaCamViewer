# TeslaCamViewer

A macOS application that allows simultaneous viewing of the front camera as well as the left and right repeaters. The goal is to allow extremely quick review of sentry mode and dashcam recordings including deleting unwanted video files on disk.

Still very much a prototype / partially unworking state, but is progressing quickly.
