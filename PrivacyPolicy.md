### Information We Collect

We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

### Analytics

Our app may collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the number of times the app is launched, to improve the app and for internal reporting.

Our app is integrated with Sentry ([sentry.io](sentry.io)). This allows us to monitor the health of the app and be aware of potential problems that we may wish to fix, such as crashes. This also provides us with analytics and reporting in aggregate.
